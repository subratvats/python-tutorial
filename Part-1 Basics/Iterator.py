# Create an Iterator
# To create an object/class as an iterator you have to implement the methods __iter__() and __next__() to your object.
# The __iter__() method acts similar, you can do operations (initializing etc.), but must always return the iterator object itself.
# The __next__() method also allows you to do operations, and must return the next item in the sequence.
